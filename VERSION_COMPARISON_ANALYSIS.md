# üîç Version Comparison Analysis: v0.1.37 (Working) vs v0.1.39 (Broken)

## üìã Executive Summary

**Bug**: Double detection - 2 overlapping bounding boxes for single license plate
- v0.1.37: ‚úÖ **WORKING** - Single detection per object
- v0.1.38: ‚ùå **BROKEN** - Double detections start appearing
- v0.1.39: ‚ùå **BROKEN** - Double detections persist

**Root Cause**: Based on changelog analysis, the bug was introduced in **v0.1.38** during the "Refactor codebase with new architecture" (PR #348)

---

## üéØ Critical Findings from Changelog Analysis

### v0.1.37 ‚Üí v0.1.38: THE REGRESSION POINT

From GitHub release notes for **v0.1.38** (published 2 weeks ago):

```
üìä Key Changes

‚Ä¢ Major architecture refactor groundwork (PR #348) üß©
  ‚ó¶ Introduces modular controllers, utilities, and overlay widgets for cleaner,
    maintainable code.
  ‚ó¶ Centralizes platform channel management and error handling utilities.
```

**This is the smoking gun** - PR #348 introduced a major refactor that likely changed how NMS is implemented or called.

### Other Changes in v0.1.38

1. **iOS performance metrics fixes** (PR #358) - No Android impact
2. **Pose keypoints reliability** (PR #338) - Creates synthetic boxes, could affect NMS
3. **Stability & memory safety** (PR #341) - Executor/cleanup changes
4. **Build fixes** (PR #351) - Permission handling
5. **Modernized Android build** (PR #352) - Gradle/NDK updates

**Hypothesis**: The "major architecture refactor" in PR #348 modified NMS logic or box filtering, introducing the double detection bug.

## üìä Code Comparison: Key Files

### 1. **YOLOView.kt** - IoU Threshold

#### v0.1.37 (Working)
```kotlin
private var confidenceThreshold = 0.25  // initial value
private var iouThreshold = 0.45         // ‚úÖ Original threshold
```

#### v0.1.39 (Broken - Current)
```kotlin
private var confidenceThreshold = 0.25  // initial value
private var iouThreshold = 0.20  // üî• FIX: AGGRESSIVE NMS - Lowered to 0.20
```

**Note**: The 0.20 value is OUR fix attempt. Need to check what v0.1.38 introduced as default.

---

### 2. **ObjectDetector.kt** - IoU Threshold

#### v0.1.37 (Working)
```kotlin
private var confidenceThreshold = 0.25f
private var iouThreshold = 0.4f         // ‚úÖ Original threshold
private var numItemsThreshold = 30
```

#### v0.1.39 (Broken - Current)
```kotlin
private var confidenceThreshold = 0.25f
private var iouThreshold = 0.2f  // üî• FIX: Lowered to 0.2f
private var numItemsThreshold = 30
```

**Key Finding**: 
- v0.1.37 used **0.4f** (40%) IoU threshold
- v0.1.39 current uses **0.2f** (our fix)
- Need to verify what v0.1.38 default was

---

### 3. **native-lib.cpp** - NMS Implementation

#### v0.1.37 (Working) - Lines 72-94

```cpp
// Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) implementation (for already sorted proposals)
static void nms_sorted_bboxes(const std::vector<DetectedObject>& objects, 
                               std::vector<int>& picked, 
                               float nms_threshold) {
    picked.clear();
    int n = objects.size();
    std::vector<float> areas(n);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        areas[i] = objects[i].rect.width * objects[i].rect.height;
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const DetectedObject &a = objects[i];
        bool keep = true;
        
        for (int j = 0; j < (int)picked.size(); j++) {
            const DetectedObject &b = objects[picked[j]];
            float inter_area = intersection_area(a, b);
            float union_area = areas[i] + areas[picked[j]] - inter_area;
            
            if (union_area > 0 && (inter_area / union_area > nms_threshold)) {
                keep = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        
        if (keep)
            picked.push_back(i);
    }
}
```

#### v0.1.39 (Broken - Current) - Lines 76-132

```cpp
static void nms_sorted_bboxes(...) {
    LOGD("=== NMS START: %d objects, threshold=%.3f ===", n, nms_threshold);
    
    picked.clear();
    int n = objects.size();
    std::vector<float> areas(n);
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        areas[i] = objects[i].rect.width * objects[i].rect.height;
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const DetectedObject &a = objects[i];
        bool keep = true;
        
        LOGD("  Checking Box[%d]: cls=%d, conf=%.3f", i, a.index, a.confidence);
        
        for (int j = 0; j < picked.size(); j++) {
            const DetectedObject &b = objects[picked[j]];
            
            // üî• FIX: CRITICAL CLASS-AWARE NMS CHECK
            if (a.index != b.index) {
                LOGD("  ‚ö†Ô∏è Box[%d](cls=%d) vs Box[%d](cls=%d): DIFFERENT CLASSES - SKIP", 
                     i, a.index, picked[j], b.index);
                continue;  // Skip NMS for different classes
            }
            
            float inter_area = intersection_area(a, b);
            float union_area = areas[i] + areas[picked[j]] - inter_area;
            float iou = (union_area > 0) ? (inter_area / union_area) : 0.0f;
            
            LOGD("  üìè Box[%d] vs Box[%d]: IoU=%.3f", i, picked[j], iou);
            
            if (iou > nms_threshold) {
                keep = false;
                LOGD("  ‚ùå Box[%d] SUPPRESSED (IoU=%.3f > threshold=%.3f)", 
                     i, iou, nms_threshold);
                break;
            }
        }
        
        if (keep) {
            picked.push_back(i);
            LOGD("  ‚úÖ Box[%d] KEPT (cls=%d, conf=%.3f)", i, a.index, a.confidence);
        }
    }
    
    LOGD("=== NMS END: %d/%d boxes kept ===", (int)picked.size(), n);
}
```

**Critical Differences**:
1. ‚úÖ **v0.1.37**: Simple NMS - no logging, no class-aware check
2. ‚ùå **v0.1.39**: Enhanced NMS with:
   - Comprehensive debug logging (OUR addition)
   - **Class-aware NMS check** (OUR fix for missing feature)

**Key Question**: Did v0.1.37 have class-aware NMS? **NO** - the code shows it didn't!

---

## üî• ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### The Paradox

**If v0.1.37 didn't have class-aware NMS, why did it work?**

### Hypothesis 1: Different Model Output Format
v0.1.38 refactor might have changed how model outputs are parsed, creating more box proposals that weren't there before.

### Hypothesis 2: Proposal Extraction Changed
The "major architecture refactor" (PR #348) might have modified the proposal extraction logic in:
- `Java_com_ultralytics_yolo_ObjectDetector_postprocess()` function
- Changed how boxes are extracted from the model output tensor

### Hypothesis 3: Sorting or Pre-NMS Filtering
v0.1.37 might have had additional filtering BEFORE NMS that was removed in v0.1.38.

### Hypothesis 4: Confidence Threshold Application
The refactor might have changed WHEN confidence filtering happens:
- v0.1.37: Filtered early, fewer proposals reached NMS
- v0.1.38+: Filtered late, more proposals reach NMS

---

## üéØ Verification Steps Needed

### 1. Check v0.1.38 Release Code (if available)

Need to see what PR #348 actually changed in:
- [ ] `native-lib.cpp` - proposal extraction logic
- [ ] `ObjectDetector.kt` - postprocess call
- [ ] `BasePredictor.kt` - predict pipeline

### 2. Compare Proposal Counts

With current logging, check on device:
```
v0.1.37 (expected): 
  === TOTAL PROPOSALS BEFORE NMS: 1 ===  (or very few)

v0.1.39 (current):
  === TOTAL PROPOSALS BEFORE NMS: 2 ===  (or many)
```

**If proposal count differs**, the bug is in extraction, not NMS!

### 3. Test Hypothesis

Run current code (with logging) and check:
```
=== PROPOSAL EXTRACTION ===
  Proposal[0]: cls=0, conf=0.783
  Proposal[1]: cls=0, conf=0.764  ‚Üê Both same class, high conf
=== TOTAL PROPOSALS: 2 ===

=== NMS START: 2 objects, threshold=0.200 ===
  Box[1] vs Box[0]: IoU=0.42 > 0.20 ‚Üí SUPPRESSED
=== NMS END: 1/2 boxes kept ===
```

**If both proposals exist in v0.1.37**, then v0.1.37 had better NMS.
**If only 1 proposal in v0.1.37**, then bug is in proposal extraction.

---

## üì¶ What Changed Between Versions

### v0.1.37 Characteristics (Working)
- Simple NMS without class-aware check
- IoU threshold: **0.4f** in ObjectDetector
- IoU threshold: **0.45** in YOLOView
- No excessive logging
- **Reliable single detection**

### v0.1.38 Changes (Regression Start)
- Major architecture refactor (PR #348)
- Modular controllers and utilities
- Changed platform channel management
- **Possible change in box extraction or NMS call site**

### v0.1.39 Changes (Bug Persists)
- Fix show overlays (PR #370)
- No changes to NMS or detection logic
- Bug inherited from v0.1.38

---

## üîß Our Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Aggressive IoU Threshold
```kotlin
// YOLOView.kt
private var iouThreshold = 0.20  // Down from 0.45

// ObjectDetector.kt  
private var iouThreshold = 0.2f  // Down from 0.4f
```

**Rationale**: Suppress any box with >20% overlap (very aggressive)

### Fix 2: Class-Aware NMS
```cpp
// native-lib.cpp
if (a.index != b.index) {
    continue;  // Skip different classes
}
```

**Rationale**: Standard YOLO practice - only compare same-class boxes

### Fix 3: Enhanced Logging
- Proposal extraction stage
- NMS comparison stage  
- Final detection count

**Rationale**: Diagnose where double detection originates

---

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Verify Proposal Count
```bash
adb logcat -s NMS_DEBUG:D | grep "TOTAL PROPOSALS"
```

**Expected in v0.1.37**: Low proposal count (1-2 per object)
**Current in v0.1.39**: Need to verify actual count

### Phase 2: Compare NMS Behavior

**Test Case**: Single license plate at 78% confidence

v0.1.37 expected:
```
Proposals: 1
NMS: Not needed (only 1 box)
Output: 1 box
```

v0.1.39 current (with fix):
```
Proposals: 2 (cls=0, conf=0.783 and cls=0, conf=0.764)
NMS: 2 ‚Üí 1 (suppressed due to IoU > 0.20)
Output: 1 box ‚úÖ
```

### Phase 3: Validate Fix on Multiple Scenarios
1. ‚úÖ Single object (close)
2. ‚úÖ Single object (far)
3. ‚úÖ Multiple objects (separated)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple objects (overlapping)
5. ‚úÖ Angled/rotated objects

---

## üí° Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Test current fix on device** with logging enabled
2. **Monitor Logcat** for proposal counts and NMS behavior
3. **Compare with v0.1.37 behavior** (if test device available)

### If Fix Works
1. ‚úÖ Keep class-aware NMS (standard practice)
2. üéöÔ∏è Adjust IoU threshold from 0.20 ‚Üí 0.30 (less aggressive, more standard)
3. üóëÔ∏è Remove verbose logging for production
4. üìù Document the fix in CHANGELOG
5. üêõ Consider upstream PR to Ultralytics

### If Fix Doesn't Work
1. üîç Check proposal extraction logic (lines 103-145 in native-lib.cpp)
2. üîç Compare ObjectDetector.postprocess() call with v0.1.37
3. üîç Check if BasePredictor pipeline changed between versions
4. üìß Contact Ultralytics team with detailed analysis
