## 🎨 Supported Tasks

### 🔍 Object Detection

Detect and locate objects in images with bounding boxes.

```dart
final yolo = YOLO(modelPath: 'yolo11n.tflite', task: YOLOTask.detect);
```

### 🎭 Instance Segmentation

Get pixel-perfect masks for each detected object.

```dart
final yolo = YOLO(modelPath: 'yolo11n-seg.tflite', task: YOLOTask.segment);
```

### 🏷️ Classification

Classify entire images into categories.

```dart
final yolo = YOLO(modelPath: 'yolo11n-cls.tflite', task: YOLOTask.classify);
```

### 🤸 Pose Estimation

Detect human poses and keypoints.

```dart
final yolo = YOLO(modelPath: 'yolo11n-pose.tflite', task: YOLOTask.pose);
```

### 📦 Oriented Bounding Box (OBB)

Detect objects with rotated bounding boxes.

```dart
final yolo = YOLO(modelPath: 'yolo11n-obb.tflite', task: YOLOTask.obb);
```
